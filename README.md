# React Application With Script Html Tags

This project was made to test the react environment into script html tags, just for curiosity.

# Running this project on your machine

You can try this, but that don't have an api to test, so you should create one to test, or change/comment some code.

  - Clone the repo with `git clone`;
  - After that, run `yarn` or `npm install` to install dependencies;
  - Then you can test using live server extension on vs code, or by opening the html file;
  - OBS: the routes work with '/#/' after the url, that's because the app is using hashRouter from react-router-dom.
